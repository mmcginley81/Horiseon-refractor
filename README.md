# Horiseon Landing Page

As a new junior developer we have worked to create a website that is more accessible. Through my refraction we have added attributes allowing for screen readers to easily read through the Horiseon landing page. Additionally, I cleaned up code to improve HTML syntax as well as streamlining the CSS styling while keeping the look and positioning the same.


## We have refracted this code based on the following needs.
## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
